Frontend goes here.

Frontend should allow stores to sign up using the wallet. 
Stores should set up their info via store NFT
Stores should set up their products via products NFT - these needs to be anchored using the store NFT

Eg.
Marketplace [ // collection of NFTs - one per store
    Stores [ // collection of NFTs - one per each product of the store
        Products // metadata can be edited and lives on the smart-contract - allows prices to change
    ]
]

In Scope - Personally Identifiable Information must be stored off-chain. 

Maybe in scope 
- Review system. 
- Encourage use of child accounts based off the main account ? 

Out of scope - Delivery management.
